# AI Progress Log

**Purpose:** Single current handover/changelog file for AI continuity across Prism work.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-29
**Target budget:** 1,000-3,000 tokens
**Hard max:** 5,000 tokens

## Current active handover

**Status:** Spectra Tier 1 (PR #22), Tier 2a (PR #23), the Spectra side of the Focus/Spectra bridge (PR #24), Tier 2b routing intelligence (PR #25), Tier 3a semantic cache (PR #26), Tier 3b-A route decision cache hints (PR #27), Tier 3b-B ExecutionEngine route-hint wiring (PR #28), and Tier 3c routing telemetry/export hardening (PR #29) are merged to `devknowsdev/prism-spectra:main`. The Focus side remains on `devknowsdev/prism-focus:spectra-focus-ai-init-20260627`. Spectra cockpit prototype work is active on `devknowsdev/prism-spectra:spectra-project-cockpit-20260629`.

**Most recent completed work:** GPT fixed mock-mode Focus chat shape. The Focus/Spectra bridge now routes successfully in mock mode, but Focus chat initially displayed Spectra's raw mock executor echo. `OllamaMockExecutor` now returns Focus-shaped JSON for Prism Focus requests that ask for JSON/chat proposals. Commits: `aaaee02fb1ce3f4f9d22fc9737daee19eb7cf08c` and `a5cbe27e99bd047a2e7df9f1caa2652a5296081a`.

**Validation:** GPT fetched the changed files back from GitHub and added regression coverage in `test/ai-request.test.ts` for structured Focus chat mock responses. Dave should pull, restart the gateway, run `npm run test:ai-request && npm run test:cockpit`, then retest Focus chat.

**Current next priority:** Pull `spectra-project-cockpit-20260629`, restart the cockpit gateway, retest Focus chat in mock mode. Expected mock answer: a short natural reply, not the giant `[ollama:mock:...] handled ...` transport echo. After local tests pass, consider a PR for the cockpit/bridge branch.

**Known caution:** Local real-model runs can use several GB of RAM/GPU and heat even when disk temp files are tiny. Ollama model storage is persistent and currently the main disk footprint. Keep real-mode validation short on M1 16GB until a status monitor exists. For cockpit work, do not add free-form shell input, hidden writes, or browser-based control of externally owned processes.

## Recent session entries

### 2026-06-29 — GPT-5.5 Thinking — Spectra mock Focus chat JSON response

Dave confirmed Focus chat now reaches Spectra and routes to Ollama mock, but the UI displayed the raw debug executor echo because Focus requested valid JSON while the mock executor returned `[ollama:mock:model] handled ...`.

Changes:
- `src/executors/ollamaMock.ts`: added `mockOutputFor()` and `isFocusJsonAiRequest()`.
- `src/executors/ollamaMock.ts`: Prism Focus JSON/chat requests now return JSON with `reply`, `proposedTasks`, `proposedSchedule`, and `followUpQuestion` instead of a transport/debug echo.
- `test/ai-request.test.ts`: added a Focus chat request fixture and assertions that mock mode returns a structured response with a string `reply` and empty proposal arrays.

Commits:
- `aaaee02fb1ce3f4f9d22fc9737daee19eb7cf08c` — `fix: return Focus-shaped JSON from mock AI requests`
- `a5cbe27e99bd047a2e7df9f1caa2652a5296081a` — `test: cover Focus JSON mock response`

Validation:
- Fetched changed files back from GitHub after writing.
- Real local validation still needed: `npm run test:ai-request && npm run test:cockpit`.

Next:
- Pull and restart the gateway.
- Retest Focus chat in mock mode.

### 2026-06-29 — GPT-5.5 Thinking — Spectra provider probe budget recovery fix

Dave's direct curl to `/api/v1/ai/request` returned `500` with `no executor within budget`; Ollama was blocked as `RPM budget exhausted (0/0)`, while free/paid providers were unavailable due missing API keys.

Root cause:
- `applyProviderProbe()` wrote `rpmLimit: 0` for unavailable providers.
- `Ledger.ensureRows()` uses `INSERT OR IGNORE`, so a stale persisted `ollama` row with `rpm_limit=0` stayed in `.demo/ai-gateway.db`.
- When Ollama later became available, `applyProviderProbe()` did not clear the old block.

Changes:
- `src/config/providerProbe.ts`: widened probe-aware `setBudget` typing to allow `rpmLimit: null`.
- `src/config/providerProbe.ts`: now writes `{ rpmLimit: status.available ? null : 0 }`, so available providers clear the startup-probe RPM block.
- `test/ai-request.test.ts`: added regression coverage that a stale `ollama rpmLimit=0` is cleared by an available Ollama probe before AI request execution.

Commits:
- `74b96c083a53d2aa61bb2a65b09bc9328790f4ed` — `fix: clear provider probe rpm block when available`
- `ddfbfca23f421c9800761654090303194451f118` — `test: cover provider probe budget recovery`

### 2026-06-29 — GPT-5.5 Thinking — Spectra cockpit guided-first validation failure UX

Dave browser-tested the cockpit and found the UI was stuck between guided workflow and process controls: it said validation failed, but did not make the next step obvious enough.

Changes:
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: changed failed-validation guidance to say `Review the failed validation output below, then rerun validation after fixing the issue.`
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: added inline `Validation output` inside the guided panel using the latest Spectra Validation log lines from the profile.
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: changed failed-validation actions to `Open advanced logs` and `Run validation again`, making advanced logs explicitly secondary.
- `test/cockpit-html.test.ts`: added regression coverage for guided-first failure copy, inline output, rerun action, and advanced-log secondary action.

### 2026-06-29 — GPT-5.5 Thinking — Spectra cockpit guided-panel log-access fix

Dave browser-tested Slice 2 and found that validation failed but logs were hard to access because the advanced drawer collapsed while moving toward it. Root cause: the cockpit auto-refresh re-rendered the whole page every few seconds and reset local UI state.

Changes:
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: added `advancedOpen` and `openLogRoles` client-side state so the advanced drawer and open log cards survive auto-refresh renders.
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: added a direct `Open validation logs` guided action for failed validation instead of only showing passive status text.
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: made the successful state expose an `Open Focus` guided action.
- `test/cockpit-html.test.ts`: added regression coverage for failed-validation `show-logs`, direct log button rendering, drawer-state persistence, and open-log persistence.

### 2026-06-29 — GPT-5.5 Thinking — Spectra cockpit Slice 2 guided panel scaffold

Implemented Slice 2 on `devknowsdev/prism-spectra:spectra-project-cockpit-20260629`.

Changes:
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: added checklist/action/guidance types and exported `deriveCockpitGuidance(profile)` for the Focus ↔ Spectra bridge workflow.
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: added `guidance` to the profile response.
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: added guided panel UI with mission, state summary, next safe action, readiness checklist, waiting state, and collapsed advanced controls.
- `test/cockpit-html.test.ts`: added guidance derivation tests.

### 2026-06-29 — GPT-5.5 Thinking — Spectra cockpit Slice 1 PID parser hardening

Implemented Slice 1 on `devknowsdev/prism-spectra:spectra-project-cockpit-20260629`.

Changes:
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: exported `parsePidOutput(raw)`, changed `listeningPids()` to use it, and filtered blank, zero, negative, and non-integer PID tokens.
- `tools/cockpit/projectCockpit.ts`: changed the external PID pill renderer to display only positive finite numeric PIDs.
